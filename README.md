# mental_disorder_prediction_symptoms

This repository contains code and resources for predicting mental disorders based on symptoms using machine learning techniques.

#### Introduction
The aim of this project is to develop a predictive model that can identify mental disorders based on observed symptoms. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, we can potentially assist in early diagnosis and improve treatment outcomes.
